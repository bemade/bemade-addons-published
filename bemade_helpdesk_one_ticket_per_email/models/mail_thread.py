        Process the routes for an incoming message, ensuring only one helpdesk route is used if multiple
        helpdesk routes are detected.

        This override filters the routes to avoid processing a message multiple times for helpdesk models
        (`helpdesk.ticket` and `helpdesk.team`). If multiple helpdesk routes are found, only the first one
        is retained, and a log entry is created to indicate the adjustment.

        Parameters:
            message (object): The incoming message object.
            message_dict (dict): Dictionary of parsed message values.
            routes (list): List of route tuples, each containing the target model and relevant information.

        Returns:
            bool: Result of the `_message_route_process` from the superclass.
